# Working with Markdown using MDX
This chapter is all about Markdown. You'll learn how to set up MDX in Gatsby, how to create pages, and how to create an events blog. You'll even learn how to use Gatsby's Node APIs to programatically create pages with URLs in `gatsby-node.js`.

You can find the finished sample code for this chapter in `sample-code/marionberry-farm-lodge`. The assignments are in the readme in the `assignments` folder. You'll use the starting point `marionberry-farm-lodge-start` project in the assignments folder to complete the exercises.
