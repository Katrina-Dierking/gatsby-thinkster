# MDX & Markdown Assignments
The starting point for this chapter is a bit different than previous chapters, so I've included the starting code in the folder `marionberry-farm-lodge-start`.

In this chapter, you've got two assignments:

1. Create a simple events page with MDX (`events.mdx`). It needs to have a title and some sort of layout, whether the default layout we created in the videos or your own custom layout. Add a "TODO" line for adding the index of events. Don't forget to add a link to the `NavBar` component to `/events`.
2. This is a three-part assignment to get you more comfortable with GraphQL and how Gatsby sources data:
   
    a. Add a new type of `frontmatter` to your example event Markdown file (the blog item in `/content/events`, not the page). You'll need to add it to the query as well.

    b. Change the date format in the page query to something more casual than `2019-11-12`.

    c. Create 5 more events as Markdown files (for a total of 6 files in `/content/events`). Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD-event-title.md` for each file and add frontmatter and a bit of basic content for each one. Get creative!

The completed code for this chapter is located in the chapter root and then `/sample-code/marionberry-farm-lodge`.
