# Styling in Gatsby
In this chapter, you'll learn several options for styling in Gatsby. We'll cover global styles (both inline JSX and imported files), CSS modules, and CSS-in-JS using Styled Components.

You can find the finished sample code for this chapter in `sample-code/gatsby-styling`. The assignments are in the readme in the `assignments` folder.
