# Styling Assignments
You have three short assignments in this chapter to help you understand styling in Gatsby. To get started and follow along with the videos, you can just pick up with the code you were working on in the last chapter. If you got stuck, just use the sample code from the last chapter (`/03-basic-layouts/sample-code/gatsby-layouts`).

## Assignments
1. Change the fonts in the Header and NavBar. You can do this either in the components themselves (inline JSX) or using the global `styles.css` file we created in the video.
2. Convert the header to use CSS modules instead of a separate global stylesheet. Hint: you should end up with `header.module.css` instead of `header.css`.
3. Create a button in the About component using Styled Components. Push yourself here: add a conditional to change the styling if a `primary` prop is detected. [Read the docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#adapting-based-on-props) to learn more and check out the [Styled Components homepage](https://www.styled-components.com/) to see an example.

In this chapter, the finished sample code (the `gatsby-styling` project) also serves as the solution to the assignments.
