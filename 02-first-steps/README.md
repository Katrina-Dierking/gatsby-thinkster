# First Steps with Gatsby
In this chapter, you'll learn the basics of Gatsby:

- How to clone a starter (it's kind of like a template for Gatsby)
- Basic Gatsby project structure
- Adding pages and routes
- Linking between pages

Your assignments in this chapter are to:

1. Clone the `hello-world` starter (`gatsby new hello-gatsby https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world)`.
2. Add a page to `src/pages`. It can be anything you want, it just has to be a React component.
3. Add a link between your page and `index.js`.

Good luck!
