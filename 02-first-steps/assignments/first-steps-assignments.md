# First Steps with Gatsby: Assignments
Congratulations on getting up and running with Gatsby! Here are your first two assignments.

## Assignment 1: Create a Hotel Site and Add a Page
1. Clone a Gatsby starter to use as a site for a hotel. It can be the `hello-world` starter (`gatsby new my-hotel-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world`) or one from the [Starter Gallery](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2).
2. Add an "events" page to `src/pages`. 
3. Run `gatsby develop` to make sure it works.
4. Add as much else as you'd like. Feel free to experiment!

## Assignment 2: Add Links to Your Hotel Site
1. This is a short one: use the `Link` tag to navigate between your home page and your events page in your hotel site project.
   
Good luck! The code I showed in the solution videos is in the `solution-code` folder.
