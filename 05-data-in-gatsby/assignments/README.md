# Data Assignments
You have two assignments in this chapter (in the same video) to help you understand data in Gatsby. To get started and follow along with the videos, you can just pick up with the code you were working on in the last chapter. If you got stuck, just use the sample code from the last chapter (`/04-styling-in-gatsby/sample-code/gatsby-styling`) as your starting point.

## Assignments
1. Add a page query to `index.js`. You could either pull in the same query from earlier in the chapter, add a property to the `siteMetadata` in `gatsby-config.js`, or do some exploring in GraphiQL to find some new data to include.
2. Create a footer for the site that uses a static query. You'll need to create a footer component, add some data with a static query (maybe add a year to `siteMetadata`?), and add it to the layout. For bonus points, use Styled Components to add some styling.

In this chapter, the finished sample code (the `gatsby-data` project) also serves as the solution to the assignments.
