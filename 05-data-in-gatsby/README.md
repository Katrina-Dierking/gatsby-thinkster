# Data in Gatsby
In this chapter, you'll learn the basics of data in Gatsby. You'll add some `siteMetadata` to `gatsby-config.js` and use GraphiQL to explore Gatsby's data structure and build queries. You'll then learn about static queries and page queries and try them out yourself.

You can find the finished sample code for this chapter in `sample-code/gatsby-data`. The assignments are in the readme in the `assignments` folder.
