# Taking Gatsby to Production
We're finally ready to take our site live! In this chapter, you'll learn how to clean up your code for production, how to add metadata for SEO using `react-helmet`, and how to deploy your site to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/home).

You can find the finished sample code for this chapter in `sample-code/marionberry-farm-lodge`. The assignments are in the readme in the `assignments` folder. You can pick up where you left off in the last chapter to complete the exercises. If you need a fresh start, just use the `sample-code/marionberry-farm-lodge` project from `07-working-with-images` as your starting point.
