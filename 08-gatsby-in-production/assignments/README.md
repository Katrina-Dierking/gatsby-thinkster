# Taking Gatsby to Production Assignments
You can pick up where you left off in the last chapter to complete the exercises. If you need a fresh start, just use the `sample-code/marionberry-farm-lodge` project from `07-working-with-images` as your starting point.

In this chapter, you've just got one final assignment in two parts:

1. Add a new `meta` tag for `image` to our `Helmet`. You'll need to add an `image` property and path to our `siteMetadata` in `gatsby-config.js` first, then update the query used in `Layout.js`.
2. Extract `Helmet` (and the accompanying GraphQL query!) into its own component called `SEO.js`.

The completed code for this chapter is located in the chapter root and then `/sample-code/marionberry-farm-lodge`.
