# Basic Layouts: Assignments
You have two short assignments in this chapter. To get started and follow along with the videos, you can just pick up with the clone you made in the last chapter. If you got stuck, just use the sample code from the last chapter (`/02-first-steps/sample-code/hello-gatsby`).

## Assignments
1. Add the `Layout` component we created in the video to the About page.
2. Create a `NavBar` component to replace the links between the Index and About pages.

In this chapter, the finished sample code (the `gatsby-layouts` project) also serves as the solution to the assignments.
