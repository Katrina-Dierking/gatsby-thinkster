# Working with Images
This chapter is all about images! You'll learn how to import images, how to use the `static` folder, and the magic of `gatsby-image`. You'll also learn how to use images in Markdown, both in frontmatter and inlined in the content.

You can find the finished sample code for this chapter in `sample-code/marionberry-farm-lodge`. The assignments are in the readme in the `assignments` folder. You'll use the starting point `marionberry-farm-lodge-start` project in the assignments folder to complete the exercises.
