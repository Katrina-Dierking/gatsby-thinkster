# Image Assignments
I added some images to our project, so I've included the starting code for this chapter in the folder `marionberry-farm-lodge-start`.

In this chapter, you've got two assignments:

- Add an image to `about.js`. You'll need to query for a `file` by `relativePath`. This time, use `fixed` instead of `fluid` to understand the differences.
- At the end of the chapter, get some more practice adding images to Markdown. First, add an image to `events.mdx`. You can simply use an inline image or go all-out and add a `frontmatter` property and bring it into `markdownpage-template.js`. Next, add images to at least two more Markdown pages in our events blog. Be sure to experiment with the `banner` property as well as inline images using standard Markdown syntax (`![image name](./path/to/image)`).

The completed code for this chapter is located in the chapter root and then `/sample-code/marionberry-farm-lodge`.
